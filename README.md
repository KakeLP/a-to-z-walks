a-to-z-walks
============

Code and datafiles for my "walking across the London A-Z" project.

This started out as KML files displayed on Google Maps.  I'm currently converting it to work as GeoJSON files displayed with Leaflet.

You can view all the walks so far at https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=http:%2F%2Fwww.earth.li%2F~kake%2Fatoz%2Fkml%2Fallwalks.kml&t=m&z=10
